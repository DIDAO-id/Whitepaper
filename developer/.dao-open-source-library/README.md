# .dao open source library

We provide several different open source libraries to meet the development needs of different scenarios. We also welcome the community to contribute more open-source repositories to the whole .dao ecosystem.

dao, but in order to maintain forward compatibility, the open source libraries will remain as DAS for now.



### front end

#### [**das-sdk-js**](https://github.com/DIDAO-id/ENS-CN)

This is a JS SDK for parsing .dao account data.

#### [**das-ui-shared**](https://github.com/DIDAO-id/ENS-CN)

This is a repository containing several common functions and UI components that can be reused to build projects similar to the official design style of .dao.\

* .dao çš„ Molecule SDK

#### [**das-register**](https://github.com/DIDAO-id/ENS-CN)
