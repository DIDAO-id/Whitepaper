There are several ideas for developing applications based on .dao:

1. Develop a trading/auction/leasing marketplace for .dao as a practical NFT asset
2. Think of a .dao account as a public, user-modifiable key-value database that can store any type of resolution record. Developers can build applications on top of this.
