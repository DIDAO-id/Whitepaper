# Application examples

[dao.cc](../../overview/faq/registration-related/can-i-register-a-sub-account.md) is a typical .dao application that treats .dao accounts as public key-value data. dao.cc can be seen as a decentralized version of LinkTree, a decentralized personal homepage. Unlike other personal home page products, dao.cc provides a home page that displays information that is centrally stored. There is and only .dao account owner can modify it, and dao.cc can't delete your profile.

If Alice owns alice.dao and adds her own links to various social networks in the resolution record, dao.cc will display these links in an extremely beautiful way, accessible to other users via alice.dao.cc. The performance of dao.cc is completely controlled by Alice through the setting of the resolution record. For example.

1. Alice can decide whether to display your decentralized home page in daytime or nighttime mode by setting the resolution record custom\_key.daocc \_theme value to light or dark.
2. Alice can set the parsing record custom\_key.daocc \_redirect value to Alice's personal website link. This way, when someone visits alice.dao.cc, the page will automatically retarget Alice's personal website.

These features are possible because dao.cc is responding to Alice's parsing history. In the future, dao.cc will be able to present all of Alice's NFTs based on Alice's parsing records. alice.dao.cc will be a truly decentralized personal home page for Alice.
